The PDF file transforms perfectly to a Word (DOCX) file and supports an additional set of document formatting features to customize the layout of the output file to match your needs. You can easily edit the content such as text, tables, images and lists from the converted Word document.

          -   Create a new instance of **Converter** class and load **PDF** as input file
          -   Instantiate **WordProcessingConvertOptions** as the convert option
          -   Call **Convert** method of **Converter** class instance for conversion to **DOCX**
          
      title_right: "Source Document Information Extraction"
      content_right: |
          The documents information extraction feature not only allows getting the basic information about the source document file but it also supports extracting some valuable file-format specific information such as project start and end dates of a Microsoft Project file, any printing restrictions on a PDF document, list of folders enclosed in an Outlook data file etc. 

          Convert popular document file formats on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux or macOS while using development environments such as NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse.

    - title_left: "Convert PDF to Excel in Java"
      content_left: |
          Turn PDF to Excel spreadsheets using a few lines of Java code. The contents of a PDF file are converted into rows and columns of an Excel worksheet that can be edited easily as you may require. A PDF file can be converted into these spreadsheet formats (XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, XLTX, XLT), OpenDocument (ODS, OTS) and Apple iWork Numbers.

          -   Create a new instance of **Converter** class and load **PDF** as input file
          -   Instantiate **SpreadsheetConvertOptions** as the convert option
          -   Call **Convert** method of **Converter** class instance for conversion to **XLSX**
        
      title_right: "Caching Converted Document Results"
      content_right: |
          In some cases, the converted document size is bigger and it takes time to be converted. The document conversion library offers the caching feature to efficiently manage such situations and speed up the repetitive conversion process. Enable the ICache interface to work with custom cache implementation using the extension point and control the cache conversion, as you prefer.

          The conversion result is saved to the local drive by default but any type of cache storage can be supported by implementing the appropriate interfaces such as Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Windows Azure, Reddis or any other.

Stamp the watermarks smartly using a handful set of watermark options to manage font, color, width, height, rotation angle, transparency and placing the watermark in the background of the document pages.
          
          The auto-detection of the source document format is another useful feature to retrieve the file extension itself in some cases where the source file is presented in the form of bytes stream. Developers can also get a complete list of all supported conversion formats when converting one document to another file format by calling **GetPossibleConversions** method of Converter object.
