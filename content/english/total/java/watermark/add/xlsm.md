        [Conholdate.Total for Java](https://products.conholdate.com/total/java/) makes it easy for Java developers to work with adding image watermarks to their document viewer applications by implementing a few easy steps.

        *   Instantiate **FileInputStream** Object with input XLSM document
        *   Instantiate **Watermarker** object using the stream object created above
        *   Use watermark image path as constructor parameter of **ImageWatermark** class
        *   Set the watermark size and alignment
        *   Add watermark to the **watermarker** and create output file
        *   Set options to view document as HTML
        *   Instantiate **Viewer** with output document
        
    title_right: "System Requirements"
    content_right: |
        The following piece of code requires `GroupDocs.Watermark` & `GroupDocs.Viewer` namespaces. You can get the respective files from the [downloads](https://downloads.conholdate.com/total/java) or fetch the whole package from [Maven](https://repository.conholdate.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/conholdate/conholdate-total).

        Insert image watermark to XLSM on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux or macOS while using platforms such as Windows Azure, Mono and Xamarin.
        
    code: |
        ```cs {linenos=false}
        // Add image watermark to XLSM in Java
        // Instantiate FileInputStream Object with input file
        FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream("input.xlsm");

        // Instantiate Watermarker object using the stream object created above
        Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker(stream);

        // Use watermark image path as constructor parameter of ImageWatermark class
        ImageWatermark watermark = new ImageWatermark("watermark.png");

        // Set image watermark alignment 
        watermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
        watermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Center);

        //Add watermark to the watermarker and generate output file
        watermarker.add(watermark);
        watermarker.save("output.xlsm");

        // Close Watermark, Watermarker and FileInputStream objects
        watermark.close();
        watermarker.close();
        stream.close();

        // View watermarked XLSM file using GroupDocs.Viewer API
        // Set options to view document as HTML
        HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources("output{0}.html");

        // Instantiate Viewer with output file
        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("output.xlsm")) {
          viewer.view(options);
          }

          title: " About XLSM File Format"
          content: |
            Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreadsheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoftâ€™s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there. XLSM files are similar to XLM file formats but are based on the Open XML format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007. In other words, XLSM are XLSX files but with support of macros. By default, Excel itself provides several macros for common use. However, you can also record your own macros with required functions.
