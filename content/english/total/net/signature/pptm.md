        [Conholdate.Total for .NET](https://products.conholdate.com/total/net/) supports signing PowerPoint presentation (PPTM) files with digital signatures using a few lines of C# .NET code.

        *   Instantiate **Signature** with input document
        *   Instantiate **DigitalSignOptions** object with certificate details
        *   Call **Sign** method of **Signature** class and pass **DigitalSignOptions** to it
        *   Set options to view signed document as HTML
        
    title_right: "System Requirements"
    content_right: |
        The following piece of code requires `GroupDocs.Signature` & `GroupDocs.Viewer` namespaces. You can get the respective files from the [downloads](https://downloads.conholdate.com/total/net) or fetch the whole package from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Conholdate.Total/).

        Sign your digtial documents with Barcode, Text, Image, Metadata, QR Code, Form Field and stamp signatures on operating systems such as Windows, Linux or macOS while using platforms such as Windows Azure, Mono and Xamarin.

          title: " About PPTM File Format"
          content: |
            Files with PPTM extension are Macro-enabled Presentation files that are created with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 or higher versions. They are similar to PPTX files with the difference that the lateral canâ€™t execute macros though they can contain macros. PPTM files can be edited by opening them in Microsoft PowerPoint and updating the contents. Another similar format is PPSM but it is read-only by default and starts the slideshow when opened. PPTM, like PPTX, contains slides for different presentation elements like text, images, videos, graphs and other related material.
